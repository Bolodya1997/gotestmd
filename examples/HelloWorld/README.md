# Hello World Example

This file will be converted by `gotestmd` into go [testify suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify#suite-package).

The file will include only one test because this example doesn't depend on others and others don't depend on this example.

## Run

```bash
# Hello world!
echo "Hello world!"
```

# Results

The result of generating a suite is:
```go
// Code generated by gotestmd DO NOT EDIT.
package helloworld

import (
	"github.com/networkservicemesh/gotestmd/pkg/suites/shell"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

type Suite struct {
	shell.Suite
}

func (s *Suite) SetupSuite() {
	parents := []interface{}{&s.Suite}
	for _, p := range parents {
		if v, ok := p.(suite.TestingSuite); ok {
			v.SetT(s.T())
		}
		if v, ok := p.(suite.SetupAllSuite); ok {
			v.SetupSuite()
		}
	}
	r := s.Runner("examples/HelloWorld")
	r.Run(`# Hello world!` + "\n" + `echo "Hello world!"`)
}
func (s *Suite) Test() {}
```
